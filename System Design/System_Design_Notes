◉ BASIC TERMINILOGIES :-

• Vertical Scaling :
  Upgrading a single server by adding more powerful hardware like CPU and RAM 
  Called as optimizing
  Simpler to implement

• Horizontal Scaling :
  Adding more servers to a system to distribute the workload
  Complex to implement

• Microservice Architecture :
  Structures application as a collection of small, independently deployable and loosely coupled services.
  Here loosely coupled means that the services have less dependency on eah other.

• Distributed Systems :
  Collection of independent, networked computers that act as a single system.

• Load Balancing :
  Process of distributing workloads, such as network traffic or computational tasks across a group of available resources to optimize resource usage and improve performance to ensure high availability of service or application.

• Decoupling :

• Logging and Metrics Calculations :
